#  Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and efficient method for securing messages and files exchanged between users, even when passing through potentially vulnerable cloud platforms. To achieve this, we propose the implementation of a comprehensive set of encryption and authentication methodologies.
Securing data during transmission from a phone to a friend's device is crucial to prevent unauthorized access by third parties. To achieve this, we can consider a combination of secure data encryption and user authentication, verification, and validation methodologies.

1.	Socket Programming: Socket programming is a computer networking concept that enables communication between different devices over a network using sockets. A socket is a software-based endpoint that allows data transmission between devices. It provides a bidirectional communication channel where processes on different devices can send and receive data.

2.	End-to-End Encryption: Implementing end-to-end encryption ensures that the data remains secure throughout its journey from the sender's phone to the recipient's device, even if it passes through cloud platforms. End-to-end encryption means that the data is encrypted on the sender's device and can only be decrypted on the recipient's device, using cryptographic keys. This way, even if the data is intercepted while in transit, it remains unintelligible to any third-party trying to access it.

3.	Symmetric Key Encryption: To reduce the computational overhead and improve transmission time, we can use symmetric key encryption for the actual data encryption. In this method, the sender and recipient share a secret key, which is used both for encryption and decryption. Symmetric key encryption is generally faster than asymmetric encryption, which requires separate public and private keys.

4.	Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): To verify the identity of the user, a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism can be implemented. A facial biometric authentication is required and key verification as the second step.

By combining these secure encryption and authentication methodologies, a system is built that significantly reduces the risk of data being accessed by unauthorized parties and provides a safer way for users to share messages and files with their friends. Remember that no system can be completely immune to attacks, but by following these practices, this system significantly increases the security of data transmission and user identity verification.


#    Methodology
1.	Socket Programming
Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server. 
a.) Stages for Server
The server listens for incoming client connections and allows multiple clients to join and exchange messages in a chat room.
1.	listen_for_messages(client, username): This function is run in a separate thread for each connected client. It continuously listens for incoming messages from a specific client, appends the username to the message, and then sends the modified message to all active clients using the send_messages_to_all function.
2.	send_message_to_client(client, message): This function sends a message to a specific client. It encodes the message and sends it over the client's socket connection.
3.	send_messages_to_all(message): This function broadcasts a message to all currently connected clients. It loops through the active_clients list and calls send_message_to_client for each client to send the message.
4.	client_handler(client): This function is executed in a separate thread for each connected client. It waits for the client to send its username to the server. Once the username is received, it adds the client to the active_clients list and sends a prompt message to all clients informing them that a new user has joined. Afterward, it starts a new thread to call the listen_for_messages function for that client.
5.	main(): The main function sets up the server socket, binds it to the specified host and port, and listens for incoming client connections. When a new client connects, it starts a new thread for that client using the client_handler function.
Overall, this script provides a basic foundation for a server that can handle multiple clients in a chat application. It enables clients to join the chat room, exchange messages with other connected clients, and interact in real-time.

b.)Stages for Client
The client can connect to a server, send and receive messages, and view the conversation in a graphical user interface (GUI).
1.	add_message(message): This function updates the GUI message box with a new message. It enables the message box, inserts the new message, and disables the message box again to prevent further edits.
2.	connect(): This function establishes a connection to the server with the provided host and port. It sends the chosen username to the server for user identification. After successful connection, it starts a new thread to listen for messages from the server.
3.	send_message(): This function sends a message entered by the user in the message textbox to the server. If the message is not empty, it sends the message over the client's socket connection.
4.	listen_for_messages_from_server(client): This function is run in a separate thread to continuously listen for incoming messages from the server. When a message is received, it extracts the username and content from the message, then calls add_message to update the GUI with the new message.
5.	GUI Setup: The script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library. It consists of a top frame for entering the username and joining the chat, a middle frame to display the chat messages, and a bottom frame for entering and sending new messages.
6.	Main Function: The main function is responsible for running the GUI application by calling root.mainloop().
Overall, this script provides a simple client-side GUI for the chat application, allowing users to connect to the server, send messages, and receive messages in real-time. 

# End to end encryption (AES encryption):
End-to-end encryption is a method of encrypting and decrypting data. It is considered very secure. The method is also known as E2EE. This is the abbreviation of the English term end-to-end encryption. End-to-end encryption uses several cryptographic methods and keys. 
The security of personal data and sensitive information is always an issue when users communicate online. In addition, data security plays a significant role for processing and storing documents or other files. Anyone who communicates with each other or processes data on the net is a potential target for attack by hackers at certain points. This danger looms in the unencrypted or poorly encoded exchange of files in cloud systems or in email communication. Without sufficient encryption, third parties gain unauthorized access to personal content. With end-to-end encryption, you protect data from theft and misuse. Often, however, the encoding is only incomplete and thus offers vulnerabilities during data transmission.
E2E encryption completely encodes data. This means that there is always a secure connection between two users on the internet or between devices and storage locations. The special thing about this is the owners encode their content. Cloud providers or internet providers do not gain access to data or information. The content remains securely encrypted throughout the data transmission process. The secure exchange takes place from the sender to the receiver. With the appropriate key, only the recipient can decrypt the end-to-end encrypted encoding and view and read information.

# How does E2E encryption work?
End-to-end encryption works in two different ways: symmetric or asymmetric. Symmetric encryption encodes data and offers the greatest possible security through AES-256 encryption. However, this also requires the AES-256 key itself to be transmitted securely and confidentially. To ensure this, Team Drive uses asymmetric encryption with a public key procedure. When data or messages are exchanged, each user generates a key pair.

Before we proceed to define the encrypt and decrypt methods for our AESCipher class, lets first create the __pad and __unpad methods.
a.)	Pad
The __pad method receives the plain_text to be encrypted and adds a number bytes for the text to be a multiple of 128 bits. This number is stored in number_of_bytes_to_pad. Then in ascii_stringwe generate our padding character, and padding_str will contain that character times number_of_bytes_to_pad. So we only have to add padding_str at the end of our plain_text so that it is now a multiple of 128 bits.

b.) Unpad
In an opposite manner, __unpad method will receive the decrypted text, also known as plain_text and will remove all the extra added characters in the __pad method. For that we first must identify the last character and store in bytes_to_remove how many bytes we need to trim of the end of plain_text in order to unpad it.

c.) Encrypt
The encrypt method receives the plain_text to be encrypted. First we pad that plain_text in order to be able to encrypt it. After we generate a new random iv with the size of an AES block, 128bits. We now create our AES cipher with AES.new with our key, in mode CBC and with our just generated iv. We now invoke the encrypt function of our cipher, passing it our plain_text converted to bits. The encrypted output is then placed after our iv and converted back from bits to readable characters.

d.) Decrypt
In order to decrypt, we must backtrack all the steps done in the encrypt method. First we convert our encrypted_text to bits and extract the iv, which will be the first 128 bits of our encrypted_text. Much like before, we now create a new AES cipher with our key, in mode CBC and with the extracted iv. We now invoke the decrypt method of our cipher and convert it to text from bits. We remove the padding with __unpad and thatâ€™s it!

# Entity Authentication with Face Recognition with GUI using Tkinter and OpenCV
Entity Authentication with Face Recognition using Tkinter and OpenCV involves building a GUI-based application that allows users to authenticate themselves using facial recognition. Below is the proposed methodology we worked on for development.
# Requirement Analysis: 
ï‚§	Understanding the purpose of the application, i.e., entity authentication using face recognition. 
ï‚§	Identified the necessary functionalities, such as user registration, login, and facial recognition.
ï‚§	Defining the user interface design using Tkinter, including pages for registration, login, and authentication. 
# Design Phase:  
ï‚§	Implementing the Overall architecture of the application with the
client-server communication.
ï‚§	Designing the GUI for registration, login, and authentication pages using Tkinter in Python. 
ï‚§	Creating a storage mechanism for user data (e.g., local database or server).
ï‚§	Used create_classifier.py integrated with OpenCV for facial recognition. 
# Implementation Phase: 
ï‚§	Implemented GUI using Tkinter for the registration and login pages.
ï‚§	Set up of a local database with create_dataset.py to store user data, including username and facial features (encodings) extracted using OpenCV. 
ï‚§	Developing the facial recognition module using OpenCV to authenticate users during login by capturing images during the registration process.
ï‚§	Tested the application with different users and facial images to ensure accuracy and reliability.
User Login and Registration Page:
ï‚§	Creating a registration page where users enter their desired username and it capture their facial images. 
ï‚§	Using OpenCV to detect and extract facial features from the captured images. 
ï‚§	Afterwards save the username and facial features (encodings) to the database.
ï‚§	Grant access only if the facial features match, otherwise, the application displays an authentication error.

By following this proposed methodology, you can develop an effective and secure entity authentication application using face recognition with a GUI built using Tkinter and OpenCV.

# Part 1: Creating GUI
In this project, we made one simple GUI using the python Tkinter library. Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python.For making this GUI we mainly used Tkinterâ€™s frame, menubar, button, label, message box, table, textbox, etc. 

# Part 2: Taking Images
When new users register it will take 300 images of that user and save these images to one folder which will be created at the time of first registration. The facial recognition module is developed using OpenCV to authenticate users during login by capturing images during the registration process. 
OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. We used a cascade classifier of OpenCV for face detection. To use this cascade classifier, we need the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file which includes all the haar cascade features of a face.
Using video frames of OpenCV it takes the frames and extracts only face images using a cascade classifier. After taking images it will store those images in a folder.

# Part 3: Sign up & login. 
If the user is registered before, he can press login button otherwise for new users can Sign-up and GUI will take 300 images of that user and save these images to the folder. For users logging in, users enter their defined username(ids) and it capture their facial images. then it will call the trainer function which will be going to generate a detector file with classifier, and it will train our LBPH recognizer using those 300 images. It will grant access only if the facial features match with the username and a pre-defined key is pressed for second verification, otherwise, the application displays an authentication error. All the new registered username will be saved in a file named namedlist.

# Part 4: Chat App Interface.
When successfully logged in a chat window is opened with server script running in the backend through which server can receive incoming requests allowing users to connect to the server, send messages, and receive messages in real-time. The server script will log which IP addresses are accessing it, and the client script will generate a GUI (after asking for the host address).
